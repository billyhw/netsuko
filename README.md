This R package contains a simple implementation of a "textbook" multi-layer neural network.

The purpose of creating this package is to demonstrate to interested viewers how neural networks are "built from scratch". 
This may be of some interests to viewers who like to learn neural networks, or users of neural networks who are potentially bewildered
by the many intricacies of modern neural networks. 

At present the functionalities are limited, and the package only supports multi-class classification.
The functionalities will however be continuously updated. This is the whole point of creating this package after all: to demonstrate how earlier neural networks evolve to modern neural networks through various scientific advancements.

# Installation
