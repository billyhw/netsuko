\description{
Pixel intensities and class labels of 5000 training images from the
MNIST database
}
\note{
The data was downloaded from the source below and the links
"train-labels-idx1-ubyte" and "train-images-idx3-ubyte". A script from
https://github.com/rstudio/tfestimators/blob/master/vignettes/examples/mnist.R
was used to decode the original file format to pixel intensities.
Only a subset of 5000 training images are included in this file.
